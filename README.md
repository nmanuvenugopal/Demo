# Intoduction to Git and GitHub

Git is the most popular and widely used version control system in the world and it is free and open source. Version control system is used to keep track of the changes that we have made to code in a special database called “repository”.

We can see the project history, who has made particular changes and why did he make changes like that. If we have made a mistake in check in then we can easily revert back our changes into earlier state.

The version control system falls into two categories:
Centralised 
Distributed

In a centralized system all the team members will be connected to a centralised server to get the latest copy of the code and to let everyone know about the changes in the code.

The problem with the centralized architecture is that if the server goes offline we can not merge our code or take a snapshot or get the latest project till the server comes back online.
In the distributed architecture every team member will be having a copy of the project with the history on their machine, so we do not have this problem. If the server is offline we can synchronize the changes directly with the teammates.

Git and Mercurial are the examples of the distributed version control system however the Git is the most popular version control system in the world because of the following reasons:
It is free to use.
It is open source.
It is super fast.
It is Scalable.

I have detailed the various process hoe to create a file or folder, how to clone the changes, Pull and Push the codes changes, verify the sequence of chnages, creating a branch etc.. in the dodument file attached (The more detailed information about the Git and Github will be updated in the document attached). Kindly go through it.
